## Ghost Updater for Microsoft Azure
Microsoft Azure allows a one-click installation of the popular blogging platform Ghost, but there's currently no integrated update option. This tool automatically upgrades Ghost running on Azure Websites in a few clicks. It is being maintained by members of the Microsoft DX team with :heart: for Ghost!

***Latest version known to update without errors: 0.6.0***

### How To Update your Ghost Blog
Good news: It's really simple. You only need two things: The [latest version of Ghost as a zip package](https://ghost.org/download) and your deployment credentials for your website. Those credentials are _not_ the user/password pair used to log into the Azure Management Portal, so let's quickly talk about how to get them:

- Go to your website's dashboard in the Azure Management Portal. 
- Under *Quick Links* on the right, you'll see *Reset Deployment Credentials*. If you're using the new portal, you'll find a *Set Deployment Credentials* button in the dashboard right in the *Deployment* section.
